"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""

text = "Programming"
reversed_text = text[::-1]
print("Reversed string:", reversed_text)


"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""

full_name = input("Enter your full name: ")
name_parts = full_name.split()
initials = ".".join([name[0].upper() for name in name_parts]) + "."
print("Initials:", initials)


"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
text = input("Enter a string: ")
cleaned_text = text.lower()
if cleaned_text == cleaned_text[::-1]:
    print(f'"{text}" is a palindrome.')
else:
    print(f'"{text}" is not a palindrome.')
Enter a string: Radar
"Radar" is a palindrome.

"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""

sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
words = sentence.split()
word_count = len(words)
print("Number of words in the sentence:", word_count)
Enter a sentence: Python is fun and powerful
Number of words in the sentence: 5

"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""

text = "This is a string and it is an example."
modified_text = text.replace("is", "was")
print("Modified string:", modified_text)
