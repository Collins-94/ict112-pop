"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""
string = "Programming"

# Using string slicing
reversed_string_slice = string[::-1]
print(reversed_string_slice)

# Using a loop
reversed_string_loop = ""
for char in reversed(string):
    reversed_string_loop += char

2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
full_name = input("Enter your full name: ")

names = full_name.split()
initials = ""

for name in names:
    initials += name[0].upper() + "."

print(initials)


"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
def is_palindrome(s):
    # Remove spaces and convert to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    s = s.replace(" ", "").lower()
    return s == s[::-1]

string1 = "radar"
string2 = "hello"

print(f"'{string1}' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome(string1)}")
print(f"'{string2}' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome(string2)}")


"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

words = sentence.split()
word_count = len(words)

print(f"The sentence has {word_count} words.")


"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
string = "this is a string and it is an example."

modified_string = string.replace("is", "was")

print(modified_string)
